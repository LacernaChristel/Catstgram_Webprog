          <h1>International Cat Day</h1>
          <p>International Cat Day falls on August 8, 2023, and is the day that marks the particular relationship cat owners have with their furry friends. This day is an excellent opportunity to show your unique, adorable pets extra love. Cats, like dogs, need some particular time from their owners. Most people think dogs are the only domesticated pets that need your attention, but this is not true.</p>
          <p>International Cat Day strives to encourage cat owners to take a few minutes to play with their cats and give them the attention they deserve even though cats may seem like independent animals and do not require playtime, their physical and mental health needs to take time out to play with them.</p>
          <h2>Fun Activities for International Cat Day!</h2>
          <p>International Cat Day was founded by the International Fund for Animal Welfare in 2002. The day has grown into a worldwide event where organizations and animal welfare bodies take the time to honor felines on this special day. Not only is it a time to spend time with your cat, but it is also an important day to advocate the safety of cats and work for their welfare.</p>
          <p>How can you enjoy International Cat Day with your pets and family? Here is a great list of fun activities you can do with your cat and even get your kids involved.</p>
          <h5>1. Adopt One</h5>
          <p>Does not have a cat can make you feel left out of International Cat Day, so try adopting one from a local shelter. This gives a loving home to an otherwise abandoned pet and provides your family with a new family member that will spread some fun and joy to everyone, especially your children.</p>
          <h5>2.Give Your Time</h5>
          <p>Consider giving your time to a cat shelter. Volunteers are always short in hand at covers in your community and can use your time. Take a few hours out, spend time at a local shelter, and invite your friends and family too! This is a great way to honor felines and provide some critical volunteer time.</p>
          <h5>3.Make a Treat</h5>
          <p>Why not look into making a home-baked treat for your cat? The rest of the year, you purchase everything for your cat to eat, but today, make it yourself. Not only will your cat love it, but you can give yourself a pat on the back for making something with no preservatives or harmful chemicals. A wholesome home-baked treat is a simple way to honor your adorable pet.</p>
          <h5>4.Invest in a New Scratching Post or toy</h5>
          <p>Take a shopping spree on International Cat Day and purchase some fun things for your cat to do. Cats get bored, too, with the same toys and scratching posts. Why not buy a few new items you can switch out now and then to make life exciting for your cat?</p>
          <h5>5.Take a Professional Picture and post it here in Catstagram!</h5>
          <p>Make taking a picture with your cat a grand event. Hire a professional photographer who specializes in taking pictures with your cat. This is a great way to remember your cat and have something you can share with friends and family to show how much you love your cat. These pictures not only remind you how important your cat is in your life it also gives your family something to remember your pet by.</p>
